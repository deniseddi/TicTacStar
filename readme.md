- Description:  
Tic-tac-toe is a classic noughts and crosses game for two players, X and O. Players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 board. The players alternate placing their marks and the first one to place three 'X' or 'O' aligned on an horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. For this project, a theme of Starwars was chosen, that allowed me to use some colorful features on CSS. As my first project, it was a fun game to build and, at the same time, it presented some programming challenges, specially building the functions on javascript. 

- Technologies Used:  
HTML5,  
CSS,  
JavaScript  
Some cool CSS features included a text-shadow and transitions properties to enphasize the neon glow effect.

-Aproach taken:  
The project started by defining the HTML structure then moving on to building functions on Javascript. It was challenging to understand the logic and  build some of the functions to make the game work. Some examples were to stop the game when one player wins and to change from one player to another.  
Another challenge, was to find a way to check who would have won. For that I needed a combination of win possibilities. The approach to solve this problem was to create 8 arrays with the winning combination inside another array and then through a nested loop, access each element of each one of the arrays and adding a counter to either 'x' or 'O' as it loops through the inner arrays. So the player who achieved one of combinations would be the winner and the game would stop.  



- Unsolved problems:  
A reset button in order to restart the game by clicking on it and storing current wins for each player for the next rounds was not solved in time of presentation.
